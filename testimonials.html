        <p>Mrs. Shashi Gupta's thought and heart speaks - Vidhyanjali is not a school, it is a home where children come with their smiles and sorrows and leave with achievements, successes and
          satisfaction.</p>

        <p>At the outset, let me thank the management of Vidhyanjali Education Society, for giving this opportunity to share my confidence about the organization.</p>
        <br/>

        <p>My child with average intelligence and little learning difficulties, has been unable to cope with the normal schools, and was finding it difficult with academics &amp; social skills. At
          Vidhyanjali, kids are involved in learning process without making them feel that learning is a tough task. The teachers are knowledgeable, talented, dedicated and caring. They know their
          students, their strengths &amp; weaknesses &amp; help them gain a glimpse of their potentials. They are focused on the overall development of the child in academics and personality
          development, as well as co-curricular activities. Lots of exposure is given to the child in the form of participation in events, field trips, activity classes, etc. This has instilled a
          great degree of confidence in my child.</p>
        <br/>

        <p>Now he is Happy &amp; Confident under the able guidance of excellent &amp; dedicated teachers.<br/>
        </p>
        <br/>

        <p>I sincerely thank Vidhyanjali for their innovative methods of teaching and wish Vidhyanjali all success &amp; great future ahead…</p>

        <br/>

        <p>I am a fortunate parent who would be able to find the best place for my kid to learn and nurture life skills along with education, which is nothing other than Vidhyanjali. I need not say
          that he achieved greater heights in all aspects of life including conventional education, life sciences, and human behaviors.<br/><br/>
          When we approached Vidhyanjali, my son was struggling with behavior problems and no conventional school was ready to accept him as their student. Thanks to Vidhyanjali for accepting him and
          guide him in a better way. <br/><br/>I wish Vidhyanjali all the successes now and in the future so that they would be able to help more and more children and families like us.

        parents of such children own a lot to the institution. The Government should come forward to aid schools like these so that differently able students and their families feel secured and

        <p>The School Management is compassionate about the upliftment of the students, and do not see the commercial aspects. The school lacks facilities, but the care and love shown by the teachers
          overcome all of these. Philanthropists should come forward for improving the facilities at the school.</p><br/>
